and speaker for audio brodcasting and microphone for videocall 


now software part 
for webapp  we are using python flask framework which is backbone of webpage 
for image processing part we are usinng python-opencv lib it helps us to detect face and pre-trained model for detecting 
mask which trained using Tensorflow 
socket.io is made in javascript for video call which helps to connect with another client on internet its a peer to peer 
connection webrtc for accessing camera and microphone of device 
database for storing the doctors info , id , database is also needed for authentication 


work completed till now 

we made a webapplication name called roboCar it has window where we can see the camera footage and person is wearing
