raspi is an open source credit card sized computer with 40 open gpio pins.
"General Purpose Input/Output", which means these pins can either send electrical signals to drive hardware or receive them 
and read sensor data. We're using them as outputs, to send signals to a servo motor. Nothing special.


A servo motor is a type of DC motor that, upon receiving a signal of a certain frequency, can rotate itself to any angle from 0-180 degrees. 
Its 90 degree position is generally referred to as 'neutral' position,
 because it can rotate equally in either direction from that point.
